### Company profile

BonsAI d.o.o. was founded in 2017 and is a part of the Span Group. We offer our customers solutions based on Artificial Intelligence with a complete service of both design and implementation, the so-called "turnkey" approach. This way customers get easy-to-use systems and donâ€™t have to be burdened by complex background processes.

Our mission is to apply Artificial Intelligence technologies in every business process which can be automated by computers, enabling employees to concentrate on tasks in which they truly are irreplaceable. We provide various solutions, from algorithms designed to find required samples or objects in pictures, to interactive chatbots that can facilitate interaction with the end user. These are all technologies that can add new value and increase business efficiency.

We believe that cognitive solutions will enter every aspect of everyday business - and we intend to fully embrace them, while still adhering to security standards. Our goal is seamless integration without compromise, aiming for a more efficient, more modern workflow.
